# Image-Predictor-using-Deep-Learning
In this project, we have developed a web-based Image Classification system that predicts the category of an uploaded image (e.g., flowers, animals, cars, etc.). The application features a clean and user-friendly interface where users can upload an image and select its category.

The backend is built using Flask, and the image classification models are powered by Deep Learning. We use MobileNetV2, a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet, as the core feature extractor. The model is fine-tuned for each category to deliver fast and accurate predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ Fast predictions using MobileNetV2 pre-trained on ImageNet
- 🔁 Transfer learning with category-specific fine-tuning
- 🌍 Web interface for image upload and prediction
- 🔧 Flask-powered REST API backend
